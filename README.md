# Ambidexter

Gem for testing network readiness for HTML stuff.

It is diploma project, so I'm gonna build Rome in one day, actually in 7 like a god, joke it has been developed since [2007](https://github.com/mojombo/god/graphs/contributors).

## Installation

Current version `v0.0.3` is working, seriously.

`gem install ambidexter`

## Usage

Firstly run server by executing `ambidexter server`, it will ask you for port number to start, uses `5899` as default.

Then run client `ambidexter client`, it will ask you for an IP address of server, it's PORT, threads and iterations counters. If you see green dots FU*K YEAH, it works, for me too. In the end of executing it will print time for each command, sure I'll find more UI way, not today.
